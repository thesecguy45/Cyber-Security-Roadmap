⚡ This roadmap builds **from foundations → core → specialized → advanced skills** ensuring structured growth into cybersecurity mastery.

# 🛠️ How to Use This Roadmap  

This roadmap is **not a strict syllabus** — it’s a **learning companion**.  
Cybersecurity is vast, and no one can (or needs to) master *every* single topic. The goal here is **progress over perfection**.  

## 🔑 Key Principles  

1. **Flexibility Over Rigidity**  
   - You don’t need to complete an entire module before moving forward.  
   - If you feel comfortable with a topic, **jump ahead** and return later if needed.  

2. **Build on Your Strengths**  
   - Already good at networking? Great — move to security fundamentals.  
   - Strong in coding? Skip ahead to web security or malware analysis.  

3. **Iterative Learning**  
   - Cybersecurity skills build in layers.  
   - Expect to revisit earlier topics as you gain deeper insights.  

4. **Hands-On First, Theory Later**  
   - Try practical labs, simulations, or projects alongside reading.  
   - Break things, fix them, and **learn by doing**.  

5. **Personalize Your Journey**  
   - Add your own notes, resources, and experiences.  
   - The roadmap is a **guide**, not a checklist.  

## 📌 Suggested Approach  

- **Step 1:** Pick a starting domain that excites you.  
- **Step 2:** Dedicate short daily/weekly study & practice sessions.  
- **Step 3:** Track your progress in this repo (or fork it for your own notes).  
- **Step 4:** Share back improvements, resources, or corrections to help the community.

✅ **Remember:** The goal is not to “finish the roadmap” — the goal is to **keep progressing, learning, and applying** what you know.
